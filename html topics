HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is the standard language used for creating and designing web pages. HTML provides the structure and layout for web pages, while other languages, like CSS and JavaScript, are used for styling and interactivity.

1. What is HTML?
HTML is a markup language that uses tags to define the elements of a webpage. It is not a programming language; rather, it's a way to organize and structure content on the internet so that web browsers know how to display text, images, and links in a meaningful way.

2. Why HTML is Used
HTML is foundational to the web because it allows you to:

Structure Content: Define headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, and sections.
Display Multimedia: Embed images, videos, and audio files.
Link Pages Together: Use hyperlinks to connect various pages.
Provide Form Inputs: Create forms for user input, such as login fields, search bars, and contact forms.
SEO Optimization: Enable search engines to understand the content on a page.
3. Core Topics in HTML
Here’s a list of essential HTML topics to understand:

Basic Structure and Syntax
